## What?
This is a fork of Andrew Rapp's [xbee-api](https://github.com/andrewrapp/xbee-api) - Java API for communication with XBee/XBee-Pro series 1 (802.15.4) and series 2 (ZB/ZigBee Pro) OEM RF Modules. Code bases diverged somewhere around 2015, and went their separate ways.

## What for?

The primary driver behind this project is the [Home Climate Control](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz) project.

## Future plans?

None for this branch - it is kept here for reference and critical bugfixes for obsolete, but important downstreams only.

Please refer to the current master branch at https://github.com/home-climate-control/xbee-api-reactive for up-to-date code.
